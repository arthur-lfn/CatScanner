## About

This App attempts to classify a cat's breed from a picture taken with the device's camera.
I created this iOS App to educate myself on the basics of Machine Learning. I was inspired by an already existing [Cat Scanner App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cat-scanner/id1447491786) available on the App Store.

The ML model implemented in this project was created with CreateML and contains a selection of 13 breeds. The model was trained using a pre-existing dataset (check the **Credits and Resources** section for further details).
